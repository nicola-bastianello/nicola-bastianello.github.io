Since 2018 I am a PhD student in the Department of Information Engineering (DEI) at the University of Padova, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. [Ruggero Carli](http://automatica.dei.unipd.it/people/carli.html) and Dr. [Andrea Simonetto](https://sites.google.com/site/andreasimonettopersonalwebsite/home) (IBM Research), and since 2019 I am a visiting scholar in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering (ECEE), University of Colorado Boulder, under the supervision of Prof. [Emiliano Dall'Anese](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/dallanese/).

In 2018 I received my Master degree in Automation Engineering and in 2015 my Bachelor degree in Information Engineering, both from the University of Padova, Italy.


My research interests are *time-varying* (or *online*) *optimization* and *distributed optimization*, see more in the [Research page](https://nicola-bastianello.github.io/research/).
